Paragraph Text and Commented Text
************************************************

Boldface is used for labels that are visible in the user interface. The UI
text is surrounded by double asterisks. For example, **bold**.

Italics are rarely used. Text surrounded by single asterisks is rendered in
*italics*.

Monospace text is used for ``code examples``. Text surrounded by double grave
accent characters is rendered in monospace font.

``.. comments can be added in a file by starting a line with 2 periods and a space.``

In English source files, look for comments addressed to translators from writers.

``.. Translators:  In this code example, do not translate such and such.``
